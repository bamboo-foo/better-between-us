# Share the Love

> How to come together and share understanding between vegetarian and meat eating cultures.

## Intro

I think we need to work together with the vegetarian movement, for in much of the world and other places aspiring to it, we eat far too much meat for ourselves and for the planet. We need balance and a holistic approach. God Almighty created our bodies to serve us in our worship of Him. We understand everything in that lens. Living with mindfulness means constantly being aware that God Almighty created everything, and instructed us in many ways. We will go back to Him and have to answer for our deeds. We do not completely rely on our thought to create an ideal utopia, rather we use our thought to expound the framework of God's revelation to better understand the world around us.

## Transition

In our worship we are admonished to want for our neighbours what we want for ourselves. That the strong amonst us must feed and clothe the weak amongst us in the same like that we are.

## Core Argument

<!-- is this Surah Hajj? -->

God Almighty has made animals subservient to us. It is not blood at an altar that is poured over to reach Him. It's not about the seemed physicality of what is happening. It is the piety; are we grateful for the bounty we have received?

Abraham (peace be upon him) was saved of sacrificing his son (peace be upon them) by an animal substitution, and animals carry our burdens for us. In remote places, there may be no vegetation, and hardly any means to farm and bring it.

The livestock we have promote a cycle of animal husbandry uplifting the community and can be slaughtered to provide for many poor and allow us to also distribute gifts amongst each other to grow our love amongst one another.

This meat is empowering, and a medicine. In concussions, and in bone breakages meat can be a vital part of healing. When things seem dire, meat can be a lifeline to greater things.
